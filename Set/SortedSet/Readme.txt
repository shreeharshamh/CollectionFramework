SortedSet
---------
-> When you want to represent group of objects according to some sorting order
-> Duplicates       : Not Allowed

Note :  Set (I) doesn't contain any methods, we've to use those methods in Collection(I) only.

Consider
{3,2,1}
{1,3,2}
{1,2,3}

in above group of set, all three instances are same, because insertion order is not important
however whether all the elements inside it are present or not is what actually matters.
